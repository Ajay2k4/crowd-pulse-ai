 Agentic AI Day 2025 –  Hosted by Google Cloud + Hack2skill 🤖🔥

Last week, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in Agentic AI Day, a hackathon designed to push the boundaries of what’s possible with Agentic Workflows, Multimodal AI, and Google Cloud's most advanced tools📍 Bangalore | 26th–27th July.
This wasn’t just another hackathon — it was a deep dive into the future of intelligent, autonomous systems that think, collaborate, and act in real-time.

🛠️ Our Mission: Crowd Safety at Scale
With my team, we built "Project Drishti" – an AI-powered situational awareness system designed to prevent stampedes and improve public safety at high-density events like festivals, religious gatherings, and rallies.


🧠 The Tech Behind Project Drishti

 👣 Sensor Mats + BLE/Wi-Fi Sniffers track foot traffic in real time without invading privacy
 📸 CCTV & Drone feeds analyzed via Vertex AI Vision for anomaly detection
 📈 Vertex AI Forecasting anticipates surges before they happen
 📲 Firebase + Gemini Pro handle alerts, live summaries, and secure mobile notifications
 📍 Google Maps API enables smart dispatching of on-ground responders
 📊 Unified Command Dashboard + field responder app deliver real-time control and communication
 


🤖 Agentic Architecture – Our 5 AI Agents
🔹 Bottleneck Prediction Agent – Uses Vertex AI Vision + Forecasting to analyze crowd flow and predict congestion 15–20 minutes in advance.
🔹 Anomaly Detection Agent – Leverages Gemini multimodal models to detect visual anomalies like smoke, fire, panic surges.
🔹 Situational Summary Agent – Uses Gemini Pro + Vertex AI Agent Builder to convert multi-source alerts into natural language briefings on command.
🔹 Dispatch Agent – Built with Firebase + Google Maps API, it auto-routes responders in real-time with GPS and traffic-aware directions.
🔹 Lost and Found Agent – Combines Vertex AI Vision + OCR to match missing person images with live video and found reports for recovery assistance.
